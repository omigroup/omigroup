The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more. Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal. Aside from technical work, OMI aims to create a community of artists, creators, developers, and other innovators to discuss and explore concepts surrounding the design and development of virtual worlds.

## OMI Core Values

- We collaborate, driven by research, privacy and accessibility, to make the metaverse more human.
- We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent. 
- We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation. 
- We empower the people making the metaverse.
- We must cultivate resiliency by championing diversity, and freedom of choice.

## Our Vision
>## We bolster the metaverse as an open and interoperable resource for anyone, inspired by the collaborative efforts of the community.

## Community Meetup

We have a weekly meeting every Wednesday at 16:00 UTC in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [AngellXR / OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E).
Agendas and meeting notes can be found in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/discussions/categories/weekly-meetings).
Informal discussions also take place on discord ([join our Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E)).

If want to catch up on topics, ask questions, or discuss new ideas we encourage you contribute to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/omigroup/OMIgroup/discussions) and come to [one of our meetings](#active+subgroups)!

## Areas of Exploration

While we don't have an official scope of work for OMI set yet, here are a few areas we are looking into.

- Identity
- Friends List / Social Graph
- Inventory / Trading Virtual Items
- Avatars
- 3D Content
- Portable Scripted Objects / Scenes

## Working Groups 

We look to dedicated subgroups to divide work based on themes of interest and availability. If the Metaverse is for anyone, we believe that anyone can add value to the Metaverse. One of the best ways to get involved is to reach out to these working groups directly (many have dedicated discussion channels in discord as well as github repos). You are encouraged to get involved with any group that fits your knowledge, skills, abilities, and interests, and help shape the culture of that working group collectively.

## W3C Community Group

To help structure our technical standards work and provide an IP protection framework we have formed a [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/about/): 
- Metaverse Interoperability [metaverse-interop](https://www.w3.org/community/metaverse-interop/)
- [Group Charter](./CHARTER.md)

## FAQ

### Are you really trying to build the Metaverse?

No. Any one group, be it a company or organization cannot build the metaverse. With OMI we hope to form consensus around ways we can turn siloed virtual worlds into a network of interoperable worlds. People have very different ideas of what their worlds should look like and how they should operate. It's not our job to tell them how to create their worlds. We aim to bring world builders together and create protocols so that traversing the metaverse is as seamless as possible.
