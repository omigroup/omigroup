The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging cultures, interests, technical and organisational areas as it concerns the metaverse. 

We bolster the community-building projects that seek to define and build the metaverse (or related things) as an open and interoperable entity. Whatever the metaverse means to you, you are welcome here. 

## OMI Core Values

- We collaborate, driven by research, privacy and accessibility, to make the metaverse more human.
- We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent. 
- We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation. 
- We empower the people making the metaverse.
- We must cultivate resiliency by championing diversity, and freedom of choice.

## Community Meetup

We have a weekly meeting every Tuesday at 16:00 UTC (17:00 UTC in winter) in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/Wqt4ZC4zjF).
Agendas and meeting notes can be found in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/discussions/categories/weekly-meetings).
Informal discussions mainly take place on our [discord](https://discord.gg/Wqt4ZC4zjF)

If want to catch up on topics, ask questions, or discuss new ideas we encourage you contribute to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/omigroup/OMIgroup/discussions) and come to [one of our meetings](#active+subgroups)!

### Future groups planned:
- physical world interoperability
Aspects of the physical world interoperability group includes immersive games, incorporating physical world assets into games, digital twins and geospatial related work. Currently this group exists as a [Discord forum post](https://discord.com/channels/887789163045335081/1344003597528076340). It is supported by an EU funded project building a human-centric digital twin for water management - [AquaSavvy](https://aquasavvy.eu/).
- convergence cultures
The convergence cultures group is concerned with online communities that bridge games or platforms. Using the term coined by [Henry Jenkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_culture), convergence culture relates to participatory culture, collective intelligence and a converging technological environment. Currently this group exists as a [Discord forum post](https://discord.com/channels/887789163045335081/1344002958911733760), pending members.

## W3C Community Group

## FAQ

### Are you really trying to build the Metaverse?

No. Any one group, be it a company or organization cannot build the metaverse. With OMI we hope to form consensus around ways we can turn siloed virtual worlds into a network of interoperable worlds. People have very different ideas of what their worlds should look like and how they should operate. It's not our job to tell them how to create their worlds. We aim to bring world builders together and create protocols so that traversing the metaverse is as seamless as possible.
